# Glossary

OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect terminology.

## Core Concepts

### Resource Owner
The entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an **end-user**.

### Resource Server
The server hosting the protected resources. Also known as the **API server**. It accepts and responds to protected resource requests using access tokens.

### Client
An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner. The term "client" does not imply any particular implementation (server, desktop, mobile, etc.).

### Authorization Server
The server that issues access tokens to the client after authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization. Authority is an authorization server.

## Token Types

### Access Token
A credential used to access protected resources. Access tokens represent the authorization granted to the client. Authority issues JWTs as access tokens.

### Refresh Token
A credential used to obtain new access tokens. Refresh tokens are issued with access tokens and allow clients to get new tokens without user interaction.

### ID Token
A JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains claims about the authentication event and the user. Part of OpenID Connect.

### Authorization Code
A short-lived code returned after user authorization. Exchanged for access tokens at the token endpoint.

### Device Code
A code used in the device authorization flow. Displayed to users who authorize on a separate device.

## OAuth Concepts

### Grant Type
The method used to obtain an access token. Common types:
- **Authorization Code** - Web applications
- **Client Credentials** - Machine-to-machine
- **Device Code** - IoT devices, CLIs
- **Refresh Token** - Token renewal

### Scope
A string that defines the access level requested by the client. Examples: `read`, `write`, `openid`, `profile`.

### Redirect URI
The URL where the authorization server redirects after authorization. Also called **callback URL**.

### State
A random value used to prevent CSRF attacks during the authorization flow.

### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
An extension that protects authorization code flow against interception. Pronounced "pixie".

### Code Verifier
A random string used in PKCE. Created by the client before authorization.

### Code Challenge
A transformation of the code verifier. Sent in the authorization request and verified during token exchange.

## Client Types

### Confidential Client
A client capable of maintaining the confidentiality of its credentials. Typically server-side applications.

### Public Client
A client that cannot maintain secret credentials. Mobile apps, SPAs, and native applications.

### First-Party Client
A client owned by the same entity that operates the authorization server. Trusted with user credentials.

### Third-Party Client
A client owned by a different entity. Should never directly handle user credentials.

## OpenID Connect

### Claims
Pieces of information about a user. Examples: `name`, `email`, `sub`.

### UserInfo Endpoint
An endpoint that returns claims about the authenticated user.

### Discovery
The mechanism to automatically find authorization server endpoints and capabilities.

### JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)
A set of public keys used to verify token signatures.

### Nonce
A random value sent in the authorization request and included in the ID token to prevent replay attacks.

## Authentication

### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
Authentication requiring multiple verification methods. Authority supports TOTP-based MFA.

### TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
A temporary passcode generated by an authenticator app. Changes every 30 seconds.

### Session
A server-side record of a user's authentication state. Persists across requests.

## Security

### Token Introspection
A mechanism for resource servers to query the authorization server about a token's current state.

### Token Revocation
The process of invalidating a token before its natural expiration.

### Consent
The user's explicit approval of the scopes requested by a client.

### Audit Log
A record of security-relevant events for compliance and monitoring.

### Account Lockout
Temporarily blocking access after multiple failed authentication attempts.

## JWT (JSON Web Token)

### Header
The first part of a JWT containing the token type and signing algorithm.

### Payload
The second part of a JWT containing claims about the subject.

### Signature
The third part of a JWT used to verify the token hasn't been tampered with.

### Issuer (`iss`)
The entity that issued the token. For Authority tokens, this is the server URL.

### Subject (`sub`)
The identifier of the principal (user) the token is about.

### Audience (`aud`)
The intended recipient of the token. Typically the client ID.

### Expiration (`exp`)
The timestamp after which the token should not be accepted.

OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage specification.

### RFC 7636
Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) specification.

### RFC 8628
