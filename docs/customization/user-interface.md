# User Interface

The Managed UI implements screens such as login, registration, account recovery,
account setting, and account verification. This allows for fast adoption of Authority.

Contrary to other vendors, Authority allows you to implement your own UI
by offering simple html templates. You can change the look of Authority `signin`
and `authorize` html pages.

Just edit the `./public/templates/signin.html` and `./public/templates/authorize.html`
