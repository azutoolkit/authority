Security is a critical aspect of the Authority authentication system. Below are some key considerations:

* **Access Control**: Implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
* **Encryption**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server.
