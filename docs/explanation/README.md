# Explanation

This section explains the concepts, architecture, and design decisions behind Authority.

## Understanding OAuth 2.0

- [OAuth 2.0 Concepts](oauth2-concepts.md) - Fundamentals of the OAuth 2.0 protocol
- [OpenID Connect Concepts](openid-connect-concepts.md) - Identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0
- [Choosing Grant Types](grant-type-selection.md) - Decision guide for selecting the right flow

## Architecture

- [Architecture](architecture.md) - How Authority is built and organized
- [Security Model](security-model.md) - Security architecture and design principles
- [Token Lifecycle](token-lifecycle.md) - How tokens are issued, used, and revoked

## About Authority

- [Why Authority?](why-authority.md) - Benefits and use cases

## How to Use This Section

Unlike tutorials (which teach by doing) and how-to guides (which solve specific problems), explanations provide understanding. Read these when you want to:

- Understand why things work the way they do
- Learn the theory behind the implementation
- Make informed architectural decisions
- Evaluate trade-offs between approaches
